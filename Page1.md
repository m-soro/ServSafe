# A brazen two-column theme

Hyde is a brazen two-column Jekyll theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It’s based on Poole, the Jekyll butler.

>Hyde is a theme built on top of Poole, which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup—just download and start the Jekyll server. See the Poole usage guidelines for how to install and use Jekyll.

Hyde includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the <body> element.

## Sticky sidebar content

By **default** Hyde ships with a sidebar that affixes it’s content to the bottom of the sidebar. You can optionally disable this by removing the .sidebar-sticky class from the sidebar’s .container. Sidebar content will then normally flow from top to bottom.
